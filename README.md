# ReversingResources
Personal articles/websites/books that I look at for certain topics related to reversing malware and windows related topics.

#Malware reverse engineering:
1.-Practical Reverse Engineering.
      -Covers nice topics related to x64/x86, not complete for the x64 Windows ABI tho, but still good read.
      -Specially because of the intro to kernel mode.
      
2.-Reversing: Secrets of Reverse Engineering/Reverse Engineering for beginners:
      -Very good book, absolutely recommended if you have no idea what you are doing, to have a relative guidance.
      -Good to mix the concepts from both books to get a better idea of C/C++ code constructs.      
     
3.-Practical Malware Analysis/Learning Malware Analysis/Malware Analysis and Detection Engineering:
      -Good books, better to extract things from each chapter that fit your needs, than reading them from start to end.
      -I personally started using IDA because of this book (Practical Malware analysis), so absolutely recommended for beginners.
